>  The project needs TeeChart for Delphi 10.3.

>  The Hard Disk Database has been made by myself, based on:
    CSC Hard Drive Bible
    computerhope.com (Maxtor, Western Digital, ...)
    Standard types: https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/hdtypes/hdtypes-3.html
    and my own Hard Disk Collection
   It can contain invalid values, so use with care, and without warranty.

>  The General VM templates are completely based on my ideas. 
     The supplied disks are driver disks from the internet, or 
     completely my creations, like the icon images.

>  The specific VM templates are also created by myself, including icon images.
     The configuration disks, the base of the icons, and the specifications
     are from various sources from the internet.
   These can contain invalid values, so use with care, and without warranty.

>  The images and icons are completely my drawings, many of them were used 
     previously in szStart Reloaded (one of my older projects).

>  The program uses code snippets from stackoverflow.com, but 
     mostly I marked these in the source.

>  I used UPX to compress the result executables.
