# WinBox-Reloaded
#### The newest way to manage the oldest computers.

This program has been created to simplify the way I use PC Emulators.
Currently it only supports *86Box*, but the rest of PCem forks are planned to be added later.

It's most noticeable features are:
- It automatically updates the emulators from Jenkins.
- It collects all your VMs in a slick brand new list, with some customization options.
- It has a very user friendly UI.
- It has a template based virtual machine creation wizard, which makes life so much easier.
- It has a collection of around 2000+ vintage hard disk geometries, so you can use any of them to your hearts wish.
- It has a real time performance monitor so you can check if you're running too many machines at once.
- It has a built in GUID based storing system for your machines, so you don't have to be aware of folder naming schemes.
- It has a large collection of custom made icons.

The program currently has 2 languages supported:
- en-US
- hu-HU

If you want to add your language to the supported list, you can find the resource file under the Translations folder.
Add your new language as a pull request and I will include it with the next release.

The program is written in Delphi 10.3.

The application is licensed under the GNU GPL v3.0 license.
