# WinBox-Reloaded
#### The newest way to manage the oldest computers.

This program has been created to simplify the way I use [86Box](https://github.com/86Box/86Box).

It's most noticeable features are:
- It automatically updates the emulators from Jenkins.
- It collects all your VMs in a slick brand new list, with some customization options.
- It has a very user friendly UI.
- It has a template based virtual machine creation wizard, which makes life so much easier.
- It has a collection of around 2000+ vintage hard disk geometries, so you can use any of them to your hearts wish.
- It has a real time performance monitor so you can check if you're running too many machines at once.
- It has a built in GUID based storing system for your machines, so you don't have to be aware of folder naming schemes.
- It has a large collection of custom made icons.
- It supports VHD and IMG formats for hard disk images (from v1.1).

The program currently has 2 languages supported (yet):
- en-US
- hu-HU
- it-IT (thanks for explorerdotexe)

Since the Italian translation released after v1.14, if you want to add to your program, you simply have to download the `Languages\Language.it-IT` file from the repository, and copy into the `<installation directory>\Languages\` folder.

If you used the installer the default installation directory is `C:\Program Files\Laci bá'\WinBox\` or `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Laci bá'\WinBox\`, depending of the  installation type you chosen on first install.

If you want to add your language to the supported list, you can find the language files under the Translations folder.
These files are simple UTF-8 encoded [C-style escape sequenced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_sequences_in_C) INI-files, can be created by any kind of text editor. 

If you want to translate the progam to your language, and got stuck, feel free to ask questions.
Add your new language as a pull request and I will include it with the next release.

The program is written in Delphi 10.3.

The application is licensed under the GNU GPL v3.0 license.
